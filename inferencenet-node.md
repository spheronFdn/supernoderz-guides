## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A computer with internet access
- Basic understanding of web navigation
- An email account for registration

## Account Setup and Funding

### Step 1: Create Supernoderz Account

1. Navigate to [supernoderz.com](https://supernoderz.com)
2. Create an account or log in if you already have one

### Step 2: Deposit Funds

1. Once logged in, navigate to your account dashboard
2. Locate the "Billing" tab on the Navbar
3. Deposit sufficient funds to cover your intended node runtime duration
4. Wait for the deposit confirmation before proceeding

## InferenceNet Worker Setup

### Step 3: Access InferenceNet DevNet

1. Navigate to [devnet.inference.net](https://devnet.inference.net)
2. Log in to the application or create an account if you don't have one

### Step 4: Create or Access Worker

1. **If you don't have a worker yet:**

   - Create a new worker by following the on-screen instructions
   - Complete the worker setup process

2. **If you already have a worker:**
   - Navigate to your existing worker from the dashboard

### Step 5: Get Worker Launch Code

1. Once inside your worker dashboard, click on "Launch Worker"
2. Copy the provided code from the command that appears
3. Keep this code ready for the next step

## InferenceNet Node Deployment

### Step 6: Deploy on Supernoderz

1. Return to [supernoderz.com](https://supernoderz.com) and log in
2. Navigate to the marketplace and search for "InferenceNet Node"
3. Select the InferenceNet Node option
4. On the installation page, paste the code you copied from Step 5
5. Configure any additional settings as needed

### Step 7: Select Duration and Deploy

1. Choose your desired node runtime duration from the available options
2. Review the cost calculation based on your selected duration
3. Ensure you have sufficient available balance (not reserved balance)
4. Click "Deploy" to start your InferenceNet node

**Important**: When you select a duration, the corresponding amount will be reserved from your balance. Reserved funds cannot be used for additional deployments until the current deployment expires or is terminated.

## Monitoring and Verification

### Step 8: Verify Node Status

1. Once your node is running on Supernoderz, return to your worker dashboard at [devnet.inference.net](https://devnet.inference.net)
2. Check if your worker shows as "Online" in the dashboard
3. If the status shows "Online", your setup is complete and working correctly

### Step 9: Monitor Your Node

- Regularly check your worker dashboard to ensure continued online status
- Monitor your Supernoderz deployment for any issues
- Keep track of your node's performance and uptime

## Important Notes

### Balance Management

- **Available Balance**: Funds that can be used for new deployments
- **Reserved Balance**: Funds allocated to currently running deployments
- Only available balance can be used for new node deployments
- Reserved funds are released when deployments complete or are terminated

### Extend InferenceNet Node Duration

- You can extend the duration of your InferenceNet node by clicking the "Extend" button on the InferenceNet Node Deployment page. Make sure to have enough available balance (not reserved balance) to extend the duration.

### Troubleshooting

- If your worker doesn't show as online, verify that the launch code was copied correctly
- Check that your Supernoderz deployment is running without errors by checking the logs in the Supernoderz dashboard
- Ensure your worker configuration on devnet.inference.net is correct

### Support

- **For Supernoderz platform issues:** Contact Supernoderz support on [Spheron Discord](https://sphn.wiki/discord) and tag mod to give you @Noderz role to access private supernoderz channels.
- **For InferenceNet-specific questions:** Refer to InferenceNet documentation or contact InferenceNet support.
